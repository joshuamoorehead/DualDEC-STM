# DualDEC-STM: Dual Decoder Enhanced Convolutional Auto-Encoder for STM Images

## Project Overview

DualDEC-STM is a convolutional autoencoder with a novel dual decoder architecture, designed for high-fidelity reconstruction of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. It leverages advanced non-linear activations (e.g., Swish, Mish, GELU) in the encoder and separate decoders for general image reconstruction and feature-specific enhancement.

## Research Objectives

1. **Develop a Dual Decoder Autoencoder**
   - Integrate non-linear activations for improved image reconstruction

2. **Quantify Reconstruction Quality and Feature Extraction**
   - Compare with traditional single-decoder models using PSNR, SSIM, and atomic position accuracy

3. **Optimize Latent Space Compression**
   - Identify compression ratios that retain â‰¥95% reconstruction fidelity

## Methodology

### Architecture
- Encoder with advanced activations
- Two decoders for distinct reconstruction goals

### Training
- Custom loss functions
- Adam optimizer
- Regular validation

### Evaluation
- Benchmark against single-decoder models using metrics such as PSNR and SSIM

## Resources

### Dependencies
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- scikit-image

### Hardware
- University HPC cluster

### Mentorship
- Dr. Peter Binev, Department of Mathematics
